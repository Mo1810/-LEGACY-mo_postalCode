# mo_postalCode
PostalCode Script for FiveM [lua]

[[IMPORTANT]]

NEEDS THIS MAP TO SHOW RIGHT POSTCODES: 
- https://github.com/Oulsen/oulsen_satmap (not mine; only second "oulsen_satmap" folder, inside the first one needed)
- https://github.com/ArduousDev/MiniMap

[[HOW IT WORKS]]
- Type in "/postcode <NUMBER, e.g. 201>" and this position will be marked on your map.
