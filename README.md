### EN translation

# IMPORTANT

NEEDS THIS MAP TO SHOW RIGHT POSTCODES: 
- https://github.com/Oulsen/oulsen_satmap (not mine; only second "oulsen_satmap" folder, inside the first one is needed)
- https://github.com/ArduousDev/MiniMap

# INSTALL
- Click green button `Code` 
- "Download ZIP"
- Open zip file, open folders until you see `README.md` and extract folder `mo_postalCode` into your resources
- Put `ensure mo_postalCode` in `server.cfg`
- Install custom map mentioned above in `IMPORTANT` through link *OR* finished pack [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuiSEy2aZSVCto1OSOiFFsd2jZzoWbLJ/view?usp=drive_link)

# HOW IT WORKS
 Type in "/postcode `<NUMBER>`" and there will be a marker placed on the map.
 - `<NUMBER>` - e.g. 201, 7920, ...

# INFO
- If you like to use this script with another map you have two options:
    1. write the coordinates for every postcode down
    2. find a list online with all postcodes and coordinates
 - In both ways I can assist you, but I will *NOT* write down the coords for you! :)
